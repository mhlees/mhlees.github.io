I am an Associate Professor at the University of Amsterdam where I lead the [Computational Lab](https://uva.computationalscience.nl/)
Computational Science Lab (Informatics Institute). I have a joint appointment at the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://ias.uva.nl) of the University as principal investigator for complexity.  Prior to Amsterdam I was an Assistant Professor at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) (NTU) Singapore. I completed my PhD Adaptive Optimistic Simulation of Multi-Agent Systems at the University of Nottingham and I graduated from Edinburgh University with a joint honours Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence degree.

My research is driven by scientiﬁc challenges in the area of social-urban complex systems. Complex Systems span a wide range of diﬀerent application areas, but exhibit common systemic behaviours that emerge through the interactions of simple elements. This systemic behaviour can only be understood by holistic analysis that necessitates viewing the system as a dynamic collective of individuals. Computational models one means of analysis that are capable understanding such emergent phenomena. One of the most fundamental challenges in this area is how to map social technical and natural phenomena into scalable and predictive computational models that can help develop and test interventions.

In order to address this fundamental challenge my research aims to develop novel methods in agent-based modelling (modelling methodology) and discrete-event simulation (computation execution). This includes methods for semiautomatic model construction, modelling formalisms that are able to capture human behaviour and new ways to probe and measure social-urban systems to be able to validate and calibrate such models. My application areas include the growth of informal settlements, the process of school segregation through school choice, the dynamics of human crowds, and the social dynamics of EV charging behaviour.
