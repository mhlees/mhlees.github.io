## University of Amsterdam

I've developed and taught a number of new courses in Amsterdam. This includes lectures in the [Master Computational Science](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/computational-science/computational-science.html), at the [Amsterdam University College](https://www.auc.nl/) and in the [Bachelor Informatica](https://www.uva.nl/programmas/bachelors/informatica/informatica.html). From 2015-2020 I was the programme director of the [Master Computational Science](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/computational-science/computational-science.html). I have also been involved in the development of the [Complex Systems & Policy](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/masters/complex-systems-and-policy/complex-systems-and-policy-kopie.html).
