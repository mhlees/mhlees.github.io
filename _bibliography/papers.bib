However the efficient simulation of multi-agent systems presents particular challenges which are not addressed by standard parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) models and techniques. PDES approaches based on the logical process paradigm assume a fixed decomposition into processes, each of which maintains its own portion of the state of the simulation. The interaction between the processes is fixed in advance and does not change during the simulation. In contrast, simulations of MAS typically have a large shared state, the agents' environment, which is only loosely associated with any particular process. In this paper, we present a model of the shared state of a distributed MAS simulation of situated agents. We consider the problems of efficient sensing, parallel actions and action conflicts, and present preliminary work on an approach to the simulation of the environment which addresses these issues.},

	abstract = {The efficient simulation of multi-agent systems presents particular challenges which are not addressed by current parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) models and techniques. While the modelling and simulation of agents, at least at a coarse grain, is relatively straightforward, it is harder to apply PDES approaches to the simulation of the agents' environment. In conventional PDES approaches a system is modelled as a set of logical processes (LPs). Each LP maintains its own portion of the state of the simulation and interacts with a small number of other LPs. The interaction between the LPs is assumed to be known in advance and does not change during the simulation. In contrast, the environment of a MAS is read and updated by agent and environment LPs in ways which depend on the evolution of the simulation. As a result, MAS simulations typically have a large shared state which is not associated with any particular agent or environment LP. In [1] we proposed a new approach to the distributed simulation of MAS in which the shared state is maintained by a tree of additional logical processes called Communication Logical Processes (CLP). In this paper we refine this model by giving precise definitions of a set of operations which allow agent and environment LPs to interact with the shared state and briefly outline how these operations could be implemented by a CLP.},

DTRD uses a decision theoretic model of rollback to derive an optimal time to delay read event so as to maximise the rate of LVT progression. The algorithm assumes that the inter-arrival times (both virtual and real) of events are normally distributed. In this paper we present a more detailed evaluation of the DTRD algorithm, and specifically how the performance of the algorithm is affected when the inter-arrival times do not follow the assumed distributions. Our analysis suggests that the performance of the algorithm is relatively insensitive to events whose inter-arrival times are not normally distributed. However as the variance of the input events increases its performance degrades to that of Time Warp. Our approach to evaluation is general, and we outline how the analysis may be applied to other decision theoretic algorithms},

In this paper, we address a central issue for HLA-based games, namely the development of HLA-compliant game agents. We present hla\_agent, an HLA-compliant version of the sim\_agent toolkit for building cognitively rich agents. We outline the changes necessary to the sim\_agent toolkit to allow integration with the HLA, and show that, given certain reasonable assumptions, all necessary code can be generated automatically from the FOM and the object class publications and subscriptions. The integration is transparent in the sense that the existing sim\_agent code runs unmodified and the agents are unaware that other parts of the system are running remotely. We present some preliminary performance results, which indicate that the overhead introduced by the HLA extension is modest even for lightweight agents with limited computational requirements.},

Such systems inherently consist of a large number of components, which operate in a large shared state space interacting with it in highly dynamic and unpredictable ways. Optimising access to the shared state space is crucial for achieving efficient simulation executions. Data accesses may take two forms: locating data according to a set of attribute value ranges (range query) or locating a particular state variable from the given identifier (ID query and update). This paper proposes two alternative routing approaches, namely the address-based approach, which locates data according to their address information, and the range-based approach, whose operation is based on looking up attribute value range information along the paths to the destinations. The two algorithms are discussed and analysed in the context of PDES-MAS, a framework for the distributed simulation of multi-agent systems, which uses a hierarchical infrastructure to manage the shared state space.

In order to avoid an on-coming collision, a set of rules for velocity sampling and evaluation is proposed, which aims to choose a velocity with an expected time to collision larger than a defined threshold. In order to improve the efficiency over existing methods, the sampling procedure terminates upon finding an appropriate velocity. Moreover, the proposed motion planning system does not guarantee a collision-free movement. In case of collision, another set of rules is also defined to direct the agent to make a corresponding response. The experiment results show that the proposed method can be applied into different scenarios, while making the simulation execution efficient.},

	abstract = {Simulating crowds is a challenging but important problem. There are various methodologies in the literature ranging from macroscopic numerical flow simulations to detailed, microscopic agent simulations. One key issue for all crowd simulations is scalability. Some methods address this issue through abstraction, describing global properties of homogeneous crowds. However, ideally a modeler should be able to simulate large heterogeneous crowds at fine levels of detail. We are attempting to achieve scalability through the application of distributed simulation techniques to agent-based crowd simulation. Distributed simulation, however, introduces its own challenges, in particular how to efficiently partition the load between a number of machines. In this paper we introduce a method of partitioning agents onto machines using an adapted k-means clustering algorithm. We present, validate and use an analysis tool to compare the proposed clustered partitioning approach with a series of existing methods.},

DTRD uses a decision-theoretic model of rollback to derive an optimal time to delay read event so as to maximize the rate of LVT progression. The algorithm assumes that the inter-arrival times (both virtual and real) of events are normally distributed. In this paper we present a more detailed evaluation of the DTRD algorithm, and specifically how the performance of the algorithm is affected when the inter-arrival times do not follow the assumed distributions. Our analysis suggests that the performance of the algorithm is relatively insensitive to events whose inter-arrival times are not normally distributed. However, as the variance of event inter-arrival times increases, its performance degrades to that of Time Warp. The evaluation approach we present is generally applicable, and we sketch how a similar analysis may be performed for two other decision-theoretic optimistic synchronization algorithms.},

	abstract = {Generating human-like behaviors for virtual agents has become increasingly important in many applications, such as crowd simulation, virtual training, digital entertainment, and safety planning. One of challenging issues in behavior modeling is how virtual agents make decisions given some time-critical and uncertain situations. In this paper, we present HumDPM, a decision process model for virtual agents, which incorporates two important factors of human decision making in time-critical situations: experience and emotion. In HumDPM, rather than relying on deliberate rational analysis, an agent makes its decisions by matching past experience cases to the current situation. We propose the detailed representation of experience case and investigate the mechanisms of situation assessment, experience matching and experience execution. To incorporate emotion into HumDPM, we introduce an emotion appraisal process in situation assessment for emotion elicitation. In HumDPM, the decision making process of an agent may be affected by its emotional states when: 1) deciding whether it is necessary to do a re-match of experience cases, 2) determining the situational context, and 3) selecting experience cases. We illustrate the effectiveness of HumDPM in crowd simulation. A case study for emergency evacuation in a subway station scenario is conducted, which shows how a varied crowd composition leads to different evacuation behaviors, due to the retrieval of different experiences and the variation of agents' emotional states.},

However, there is no formal approach of using these concepts in crowd simulation. In this paper, we propose a flexible and efficient framework of Intelligent Environment with Smart and Active Objects (IESAO). We properly define different types of entities and interactions, and describe the approach of modeling environment-related behavior in the intelligent environment. This framework gives a new perspective of modeling human behavior in the design phase. An implementation and a case study are discussed to show the flexibility and efficiency of this framework.},

This effort is often for the sake of enhancing scalability, interoperability, composability and enabling information security. Synchronization mechanisms are essential to coordinate the execution of federates and event transmissions across the boundaries of interlinked federations. We have developed a generic synchronization mechanism for federation community networks with its correctness mathematically proved. The synchronization mechanism suits various types of federation community network and supports the reusability of legacy federates. It is platform-neutral and independent of federate modeling approaches. The synchronization mechanism has been evaluated in the context of the Grid-enabled federation community approach, which allows simulation users to benefit from both Grid computing technologies and the federation community approach. A series of experiments has been carried out to validate and benchmark the synchronization mechanism. The experimental results indicate that the proposed mechanism provides correct time management services to federation communities. The results also show that the mechanism exhibits encouraging performance in terms of synchronization efficiency and scalability.},

One popular motivation for simulation of virtual crowds is to generate believable characters in movies and computer games. Recently the concept of serious games has been introduced in both academic and industrial circles. In this paper, we propose an emotion engine, based on modern appraisal theory, that is able to model various emotional crowd characteristics. This appraisal engine is capable of capturing the dynamics of emotional contagion and we show how different crowd composition can lead to different patterns of emotional contagion. In addition, we describe a serious game designed for training military personnel in peaceful crowd control. We evaluate this engine in the context of a property protection protest scenario where the players or soldiers are tasked to maintain a peaceful protest without violence. A systematic evaluation is presented which supports the facial validity of the emotion engine and our model of emotional contagion.},

For school closure with a relatively short duration ({\textless} 6 weeks), it is more effective to start closure after a relatively longer delay from the first day of infection; if the duration of school closure is long ({\textgreater}6 weeks), however, it is better to start it as early as reasonable.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is believed that combined interventions may be more effective than individual interventions in mitigating epidemic. However there is a lack of quantitative studies on performance of the combination of individual interventions under different temporal settings. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To better understand the problem, we develop an individual-based simulation model running on top of contact networks based on real-life contact data in Singapore. We model and evaluate the spread of influenza epidemic with intervention strategies of workforce shift and its combination with school closure, and examine the impacts of temporal factors, namely the trigger threshold and the duration of an intervention. By comparing simulation results for intervention scenarios with different temporal factors, we find that combined interventions do not always outperform individual interventions and are more effective only when the duration is longer than 6 weeks or school closure is triggered at the 5\% threshold; combined interventions may be more effective if school closure starts first when the duration is less than 4 weeks or workforce shift starts first when the duration is longer than 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We therefore conclude that identifying the appropriate timing configuration is crucial for achieving optimal or near optimal performance in mitigating the spread of influenza epidemic. The results of this study are useful to policy makers in deliberating and planning individual and combined interventions.},

Researchers have been searching for solutions by investigating better urban planning and transportation policies, introducing new technologies such as Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), or introducing more environmentally friendly vehicles such as electric vehicles (EVs). Traffic modeling and simulation is one tool adopted by researchers for more than half a century [to help authorities assess new infrastructure design, and new policies without impacting real traffic. City-scale nanoscopic traffic simulation is a challenging problem that requires parallelization and distribution. In this paper, we have given an overview of the architecture for our nanoscopic traffic simulator SEMSim. For efficient parallel simulation, reducing the dependencies between the various LPs is crucial. We have specified a multi-objective optimization problem concerned with the allocation of agents to clusters. In our future work, we will implement a nanoscopic traffic simulation and devise methods to solve this problem dynamically. Given the difficulty of the problem, these methods will have to make use of domain-specific knowledge, such as information about the topology of the road network.},

Simulations are used to investigate different treatment regimens. The response to the addition of inhibitor is found to depend significantly on the form of the positive feedback in the quorum-sensing model; in cases where the model exhibits bistability, the time at which treatment is initiated proves to be critical for the effective prevention of quorum sensing and hence potentially of virulence.},

At the core of this smart transportation system would be a symbiotic simulation system which incorporates information provided by the various traffic participants into city-scale traffic simulations. We describe the symbiotic simulation system and highlight the research challenges that need to be addressed in order to realize such a system. This includes a server-based city-scale simulation which would forecast general traffic patterns and conditions in the near-future.

During its foraging behavior the plasmodium spans sources of nutrients with a network of protoplasmic tubes. In this paper we attempt to address the following question: Is slime mould capable of computing transport networks? By assuming the sources of nutrients are cities and protoplasmic tubes connecting the sources are motorways, how well does the plasmodium approximate existing motorway networks? We take the Netherlands as a case study for bio-development of motorways, while it has the most dense motorway network in Europe, current demand is rapidly approaching the upper limits of existing capacity. We represent twenty major cities with oat flakes, place plasmodium in Amsterdam and record how the plasmodium spreads between oat flakes via the protoplasmic tubes. First we analyze slime-mould-built and man-built transport networks in a framework of proximity graphs to investigate if the slime mould is capable of computing existing networks. We then go on to investigate if the slime mould is able calculate or adapt the network through imitating restructuring of the transport network as a response to potential localized flooding of the Netherlands.

	abstract = {Agent-based modelling of human crowds has now become an important and active research field, with a wide range of applications such as military training, evacuation analysis and digital game. One of the significant and challenging tasks in agent-based crowd modelling is the design of decision rules for agents, so as to reproduce desired emergent phenomena behaviors. The common approach in agent-based crowd modelling is to design decision rules empirically based on model developers experiences and domain specific knowledge. In this paper, an evolutionary framework is proposed to automatically extract decision rules for agent-based crowd models, so as to reproduce an objective crowd behavior. To automate the rule extraction process, the problem of finding optimal decision rules from objective crowd behaviors is formulated as a symbolic regression problem. An evolutionary framework based on gene expression programming is developed to solve the problem. The proposed algorithm is tested using crowd evacuation simulations in three scenarios with differing complexity. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and shows that our algorithm is able to find decision rules for agents, which in turn can generate the prescribed macro-scale dynamics.},

In this paper, a graph-based dynamic load-balancing mechanism which minimizes the communication overhead during load-balancing operations is developed. Its efficiency is investigated in the agent-based traffic simulator SEMSim Traffic using real world traffic data. Experiment results show that it has significantly better performance than static graph partitioning methods in improving the overall speed of the simulation.},

One important issue is to devise the evacuation plans of individuals in emergency situations so as to reduce the total evacuation time. This paper proposes a novel evolutionary algorithm (EA)-based methodology, together with agent-based crowd simulation, to solve the evacuation planning problem. The proposed method features a novel segmentation strategy which divides the entire evacuation region into sub-regions based on a discriminant function. Each sub-region is assigned with an exit gate, and individuals in a sub-region will run toward the corresponding exit gate for evacuation. In this way, the evacuation planning problem is converted to a symbolic regression problem. Then an evolutionary algorithm, using agent-based crowd simulation as fitness function, is developed to search for the global optimal solution. The simulation results on different scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method is effective to reduce the evacuation time.},

	abstract = {Serious games have recently shown great potential to be adopted in many applications, such as training and education.However, one critical challenge in developing serious games is the authoring of a large set of scenarios for differenttraining objectives. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to automatically generate scenarios for serious games.Compared with other scenario generation methods, our approach leverages on the simulated player performance data toconstruct the scenario evaluation function for scenario generation. To collect the player performance data, an artificialintelligence (AI) player model is designed to imitate how a human player behaves when playing scenarios. The AI playersare used to replace human players for data collection. The experiment results show that our data-driven approach providesgood prediction accuracy on scenarios training intensities. It also outperforms our previous heuristic-based approach in itscapability of generating scenarios that match closer to specified target player performance},

	abstract = {Crowd simulation is rapidly becoming a standard tool for evacuation planning and evaluation. However, the many crowd models in the literature are structurally different, and few have been rigorously calibrated against real-world egress data, especially in emergency situations. In this paper we describe a procedure to quantitatively compare different crowd models or between models and real-world data. We simulated three models: (1) the lattice gas model, (2) the social force model, and (3) the RVO2 model, and obtained the distributions of six observables: (1) evacuation time, (2) zoned evacuation time, (3) passage density, (4) total distance traveled, (5) inconvenience, and (6) flow rate. We then used the DISTATIS procedure to compute the compromise matrix of statistical distances between the three models. Projecting the three models onto the first two principal components of the compromise matrix, we find the lattice gas and RVO2 models are similar in terms of the evacuation time, passage density, and flow rates, whereas the social force and RVO2 models are similar in terms of the total distance traveled. Most importantly, we find that the zoned evacuation times of the three models to be very different from each other. Thus we propose to use this variable, if it can be measured, as the key test between different models, and also between models and the real world. Finally, we compared the model flow rates against the flow rate of an emergency evacuation during the May 2008 Sichuan earthquake, and found the social force model agrees best with this real data.},

	abstract = {Crowd modeling and simulation is an important and active research field, with a wide range of applications such as computer games, military training and evacuation modeling. One important issue in crowd modeling is model calibration through parameter tuning, so as to produce desired crowd behaviors. Common methods such as trial-and-error are time consuming and tedious. This paper proposes an evolutionary framework to automate the crowd model calibration process. In the proposed framework, a density-based matching scheme is introduced. By using the dynamic density of the crowd over time, and a weight landscape to emphasize important spatial regions, the proposed matching scheme provides a generally applicable way to evaluate the simulated crowd behaviors. Besides, a hybrid search mechanism based on differential evolution is proposed to efficiently tune parameters of crowd models. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework is effective and efficient to calibrate the crowd models in order to produce desired macroscopic crowd behaviors.},
