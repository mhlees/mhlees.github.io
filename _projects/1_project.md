The Research Priority Area, Emergent Phenomena in Society: Polarisation, Segregation and Inequality (RPA PSI) is an interdisciplinary collaboration at the University of Amsterdam with the goal of uncovering the interplay between the various mechanisms underlying the social phenomena of polarization, segregation and inequality combining fundamental research and societal-driven (non-academic) research. The collaboration involves various faculties at the University of Amsterdam, including the Faculty of Science (FNWI), the Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB), the Faculty of Social and Behavioral Sciences (FMG) and the Faculty of Law (FdR) as well as the the knowledge institute Statistics Netherlands (CBS).
