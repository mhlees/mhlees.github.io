Computational modelling of psychological and social dynamics in urban mental health conditions: the case of addictive substance use

This project will develop novel computational models to study the dynamics of addictive substance (ab)use. The central hypothesis is that the dynamics of addiction and mental health issues are driven by psychological and social dynamics and the aim is to build complex system models to understand this by forming a computational modeling framework that integrates psychological and social levels of explanation. This modeling framework will be applied to study the interplay of substance use and mental health and will provide a toolbox applicable to study other common mental health conditions throughout the Centre for Urban Mental Health.
