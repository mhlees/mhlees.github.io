The growth of electric driving creates a demand for good charging infrastructure. The IDO charging (Intelligent Data-driven Optimization of Charging Infrastructure) research team analyzes charging behavior.

More electric cars and fewer conventional cars in Amsterdam: this contributes to better air quality. With the growth of electric driving, the demand for sufficient charging infrastructure also increases. How many charging stations should there be, when and where is the best place? The IDO-laad project analyzes 'charging behavior'. The research results help the municipality make electric transport in the city attractive and grow.

In Amsterdam we focus on developing computationa models to help understand the future of the charging landscape and how the behavioural interaction between chargers leads to complex emergent phenomena.

## CHARGING BEHAVIOR

IDO-laad investigates 'charging behavior': where, when and for how long do people use the charging stations.

Where is the need for charging stations and what type of charging station should there be?
When do people want to charge their car? What happens when it is very busy or very quiet at the charging stations? And how can the demand and supply of energy be matched?
How long does a charging session take and when is that a problem, for example because others also want to charge?
With the results of this research, IDO charging helps policymakers monitor the use of the charging infrastructure and determine new policy. They get an idea of ​​the use of the charging stations; information that is important for determining new policy.
